# About Me

Hi, I'm Pallavi 👋

I'm a data science enthusiast with a growing interest in the research space at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human behavior. My background and projects reflect a strong foundation in data analysis, storytelling, and a curiosity for understanding how humans interact with systems.

I’m building a portfolio that not only demonstrates technical competence, but also explores how behavioral data and cognitive insights can inform more intelligent and ethical AI systems.
